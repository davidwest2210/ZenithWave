Overview
ZenithWave is built to solve real-world enterprise needs. It focuses on reliable performance under load, clean separation of concerns, and a design that adapts to growing requirements. The platform supports modern design languages and provides optimization features that help teams tune workloads, reduce cost, and improve response times. It aims to be predictable, observable, and easy to operate across multiple environments.

Why ZenithWave matters
- Enterprise readiness: It is designed for teams that manage large deployments across several regions. It includes governance, role-based access, and audit-friendly operations.
- ZenithWave optimization: The platform ships with engine capabilities that help property owners and operators fine-tune workloads, pacing, and resource use.
- Modern design: The UI and UX follow current design standards, making it easier for teams to adopt and use effectively.
- Extensibility: The architecture supports plugins and integrations to fit diverse ecosystems.
- Reliability: The platform emphasizes resilience, testable components, and recoverability.

Core ideas and design principles
- Simplicity with power: The system stays simple where possible but adds depth where it matters.
- Clear boundaries: Each component has a single responsibility and communicates via well-defined interfaces.
- Observability by design: Metrics, logs, and traces are built in from the start.
- Safe defaults: Default configurations are secure and sensible for most use cases.
- Forward compatibility: The architecture accommodates future changes without breaking existing deployments.

Architecture at a glance
- Core Engine: The central processor for optimization tasks, workload orchestration, and rule evaluation.
- UI Layer: A modern, responsive interface for operators and developers.
- API Gateway: A stable surface for internal and external integrations.
- Data Layer: A scalable storage stack with strong consistency guarantees when needed.
- Identity and Access: RBAC, SSO, and auditing features to meet compliance needs.
- Observability Stack: Metrics, logs, and traces collected and surfaced for troubleshooting.
- Deployment and Orchestration: Supports containers and cloud-native deployment patterns.

The architecture is designed to be decomposed into services with clear contracts. Each service is independently deployable, testable, and scalable. The system favors asynchronous messaging where appropriate, and it provides consistent runtime environments across development, staging, and production.

Getting started
If you are evaluating ZenithWave for your team, start with the Releases page to obtain the installer or package for your platform. The installer provides a guided setup that configures core components and enables you to begin testing quickly. The releases page is the primary distribution point for deployment artifacts and update material.

Installation and setup
- Prerequisites
  - A supported operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux) with current security updates.
  - Sufficient CPU and memory for the intended workload. A baseline of 4 cores and 8 GB RAM is a practical starting point for light workloads; larger environments benefit from more headroom.
  - Network access to required services and endpoints used by ZenithWave. This includes cloud accounts, identity providers, and data stores as defined by your deployment plan.
  - Administrative rights for installing services and configuring system components.
- Getting the installer
  - The latest installer or distribution package is available on the Releases page. From the Releases page, download the appropriate artifact for your platform and follow the on-screen prompts.
  - The releases page is the canonical source for versioned builds, updates, and changelogs.
- Onboarding and initial configuration
  - Run the installer with administrative privileges.
  - Follow the guided setup to configure core components, including identity, data stores, and the first set of optimization rules.
  - Connect to your environment’s cloud accounts or on-prem resources as needed.
  - Confirm that health checks pass and monitor the initial bootstrap through the UI dashboards.
- Post-install basics
  - Create the first administrator account and define access policies.
  - Enable basic monitoring and alerting to track health and performance.
  - Review sample optimization rules and tailor them to your workload patterns.

Quick start guide
- Start a new project
  - Open the UI and create a project named “FirstDeployment.”
  - Add a small, representative workload to test the optimization pipeline.
- Run a basic optimization
  - Use a pre-defined rule set designed for baseline performance.
  - Observe metrics such as throughput, latency, and error rates as the optimization runs.
- Validate results
  - Compare baseline and post-optimization metrics.
  - Verify that security, access controls, and logging remain intact.
- Extend step-by-step
  - Add a new integration with your data source.
  - Create an additional rule to optimize a different workload segment.
  - Save and deploy; monitor the system’s response to changes.

Configuration and environment
- Configuration model
  - Configuration is expressed through a mix of environment variables, YAML/JSON files, and platform-specific settings.
  - Common categories include: security, networking, data storage, and optimization rules.
- Environment variables (examples)
  - ZW_APP_ENV=production
  - ZW_LOG_LEVEL=info
  - ZW_MAX_WORKERS=16
  - ZW_DATA_STORE_URL=postgres://user:pass@db.example.com:5432/zenith
  - ZW_API_ENDPOINT=https://api.example.com
- Configuration files
  - config.yaml: Core settings for the engine and orchestration backends.
  - rules.yaml: Declarative optimization rules for workloads.
  - ui_settings.json: UI customization and feature toggles.
- Secrets management
  - Use your platform’s secret management service or a secure vault.
  - Do not hard-code credentials in files. Reference secrets via environment variables or API calls.
- Local development vs. production
  - Local development uses mock data sources and simplified configurations.
  - Production deployments rely on full data stores, cloud services, and robust security controls.
- Localization and accessibility
  - The UI supports multiple languages and accessible controls per WCAG guidance.
  - Add language packs via the configuration and verify keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.

Working with data
- Data model overview
  - The platform uses a modular data model with entities for workloads, rules, runs, results, and audit trails.
  - Relationships are defined with clear foreign keys and indices to support fast queries.
- Data stores
  - Primary relational store for configuration and metadata (e.g., PostgreSQL).
  - Time-series store for performance metrics and telemetry (e.g., Prometheus, or a compatible store).
  - Optional search index for fast lookups (e.g., Elasticsearch).
- Data integrity
  - Validation rules run at the edge of write paths.
  - Transactions ensure consistency across critical updates.
- Data retention
  - Policies determine how long telemetry and logs are kept.
  - Archival processes move older data to cold storage or external repositories.
- Data access controls
  - Fine-grained access policies govern who can read or modify data.
  - Audit logs capture changes to configurations and rules.

APIs and integration
- API surface
  - RESTful endpoints cover core operations for workloads, rules, runs, and results.
  - A GraphQL interface is available for flexible queries in advanced use cases.
- Authentication and authorization
  - Integrates with enterprise identity providers via OAuth2 or SAML SSO.
